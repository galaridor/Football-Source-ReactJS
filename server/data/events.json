Germany will host the tournament, which is scheduled to take place from 14 June to 14 July 2024. It will be the third time that European Championship matches are played on German territory and the second time in reunified Germany as the former West Germany hosted the tournament of 1988, and four matches of the multi-national Euro 2020 were played in Munich. It will be the first time the competition is held in what was formerly East Germany with Leipzig as a host city, as well as the first time that a reunified Germany served as a solo host nation. The tournament will return to its usual four-year cycle, after Euro 2020 was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Italy are the defending champions, having won the 2020 tournament after beating England on penalties in the final.",
